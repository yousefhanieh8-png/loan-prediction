# Loan Prediction Model

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details.  
It uses **Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and SVM (Support Vector Machine)**.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn (SVM, train_test_split, StandardScaler)  

## 📊 Steps
1. Data preprocessing and encoding  
2. Feature scaling with StandardScaler  
3. Splitting data into train/test sets  
4. Training the model with SVM  
5. Model evaluation and prediction  

## 📝 Example Prediction
- `1` → Loan Approved ✅  
- `0` → Loan Not Approved ❌
